Personal project I played during college time. If anyone think useful, he/she can use without any  condition. I will be happy to give the code.

Written in PHP and based on CakePHP framework.

Description:
---------------------------------------
Letting the users communicate privately and securely. A user can choose whom (from his network) he wants to whisper and send them the whisper message or photos. These users will communicate on that whisper message securely. No other user can see even if he/she is in the network of one of those users involved.

Developed in the hope of creating next generation of email. Implemented by Cake PHP Framework, Zend Modules. JQuery is used for AJAX requests and UI features. (This project can be seen upon request)
